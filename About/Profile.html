            A highly motivated and driven individual who is very capable of integrating into a team environment as well as self-motivated projects and individual undertakings.

            Whilst very busy at work, I like to keep myself busy at the weekends with walks on the beach, reading, word puzzles (particularly thematic cryptic crosswords), and knitting. My currently work life is very busy so I like to unwind from that with quieter activities and socialising with friends by going for meals.
