        <h1>Cover Letter</h1>
        <p>
            To whom it may concern<br><br>
            I would like to present to you the candidate you 
            have been looking for. Laura is a highly skilled 
            laboratory analyst who has extensive knowledge of 
            everything anyone could ever need to know about 
            HPLC analysis and other chromatograpic methods alike.
            Laura has never missed an opportunity to develop her
            skillset even when it wasn't necessarily relevant to 
            the "right now", she always wants to learn new things
            in case they're relevant at a later point. This 
            thirst for knowledge isn't limited to the working 
            environment, either. 
            <br><br>Laura is always taking in new 
            information from watching (and participating in) 
            quizzes; nothing is arbitrary and all facts get 
            stored somewhere for a later date. <br><br> I can assure 
            you with the skills and thirst for knowledge that 
            Laura has, you will not find a more ideal candidate 
            for this role. 
            <br><br>Thanks in advance, 
            <br> Laura MacKenzie.
